        <div class="tp-content">
            If a payment is 120 days overdue, your loan will be charged off and may be sent to a third-party collections agency. Affirm can continue to accept payments until our third-party collections partner receives your loan. This usually takes five calendar days. If you'd like to make a payment within this timeframe, you must call in to do so. Note that once your loan is charged off, the status is irreversible.

        <div class="tp-header"><span class="tp-icon">üó£Ô∏è</span>What was the purchase?</div>
        <div class="tp-content">
            We don't have access to that information. Affirm is only the way the customers choose to pay for items. The customer requests for the loan, if the loan is approved, we only transfer the money to the merchant and the merchant sends the items to the customer. So, if you need more information about your purchase, you need to contact the merchant.<br><br>
            If you choose Affirm by mistake to pay for your purchase, you need to contact the merchant and ask them to correct the payment made with Affirm and make the payment again with the payment instrument that you prefer.

        <div class="tp-header"><span class="tp-icon">üó£Ô∏è</span>Merchant Dispute</div>
        <div class="tp-content">
            We only handle the financial part of the purchase, refunds, returns, and cancellations are subject to the merchant policies. Until we receive a full refund, the loan will still be active, and therefore you are still responsible for the repayment of it. Something very important too is that if we receive only a partial refund, you will be responsible only for the remaining balance. And, if we receive a full refund and you have made payments, we are gonna refund those payments less any accurate interests, within 3-10 business days.<br><br>
            We suggest that you keep covering the payments as long as we are waiting for the refund to show just to be in good standing with our company once that late payment might affect your ability to take future loans. If the refunded amount exceeds your remaining loan balance, we'll directly refund the difference, less any accrued interest, to your original form of payment within 3-10 business days.
